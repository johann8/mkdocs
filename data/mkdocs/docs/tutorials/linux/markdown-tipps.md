Layouts are written in YAML syntax. Before starting to create a custom layout,
it is a good idea to [study the pre-designed layouts] (link to [Insiders]
repository), in order to get a better understanding of how they work. Then,
create a new layout and reference it in `mkdocs.yml`:

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: `custom.yml`"

    ``` yaml
    size: { width: 1200, height: 630 }
    layers: []
    ```

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: `mkdocs.yml`"

    ``` yaml
    plugins:
      - social:
          cards_layout_dir: layouts
          cards_layout: custom
          debug: true
    ```

### tip

!!! tip "Automatically bundle Google Fonts"

    The [built-in privacy plugin] makes it easy to use Google Fonts
    while complying with the __General Data Protection Regulation__ (GDPR),
    by automatically downloading and self-hosting the web font files.

[Docker] improves the user experience when switching between languages, e.g.,
if language `en` and `de` contain a page with the same path name, the user will
stay on the current page:

No configuration is necessary. We're working hard on improving multi-language
support in 2024, including making switching between languages even more seamless
in the future.

### info

!!! info

    Values in **bold** are the default values. If an option doesn't work as documented here, check if you are running the latest image. The current `master` branch corresponds to the image `ghcr.io/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver:edge`.

---

### quote

!!! quote "What is Fail2Ban (F2B)?"

    Fail2ban is an intrusion prevention software framework. Written in the Python programming language, it is designed to prevent against brute-force attacks. It is able to run on POSIX systems that have an interface to a packet-control system or firewall installed locally, such as \[NFTables\] or TCP Wrapper.

    [Source][wikipedia-fail2ban]

    [wikipedia-fail2ban]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail2ban

### warning

!!! warning

    DMS must be launched with the `NET_ADMIN` capability in order to be able to install the NFTables rules that actually ban IP addresses. Thus, either include `--cap-add=NET_ADMIN` in the `docker run` command, or the equivalent in the `compose.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    ```

### bug

!!! bug "Running Fail2Ban on Older Kernels"

    DMS configures F2B to use NFTables, not IPTables (legacy). We have observed that older systems, for example NAS systems, do not support the modern NFTables rules. You will need to configure F2B to use legacy IPTables again, for example with the [``fail2ban-jail.cf``][github-file-f2bjail], see the [section on configuration further down below](#custom-files).


### question
!!! question "What is [`docker-data/dms/config/`][docs::dms-volumes-config]?"

### note

!!! note "About The Mail Server's Fully Qualified Domain Name"

    The mail server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in our example above is `mail.example.com`. Please note though that this is more of a convention, and not due to technical restrictions. One could also run the mail server

    1. on `foo.example.com`: you would just need to change your `MX` record;
    2. on `example.com` directly: you would need to change your `MX` record and probably [read our docs on bare domain setups][docs-faq-bare-domain], as these setups are called "bare domain" setups.

    The FQDN is what is relevant for TLS certificates, it has no (inherent/technical) relation to the email addresses and accounts DMS manages. That is to say: even though DMS runs on `mail.example.com`, or `foo.example.com`, or `example.com`, there is nothing that prevents it from managing mail for `barbaz.org` - `barbaz.org` will just need to set its `MX` record to `mail.example.com` (or `foo.example.com` or `example.com`).

### Font awesome

- :fontawesome-brands-github: [mailcow/mailcow-dockerized @ GitHub](https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized)

- :fontawesome-solid-globe: [mailcow.email](https://mailcow.email)

### question

!!! question
    Mailcow, MailCow or mailcow? What is the exact name of the project?

    Correct: **mailcow**, because mailcow is a registered word mark with a small m :grin:

mailcow: dockerized is an open source groupware/email suite based on docker.

### abstract

!!! abstract "Use these credentials for the demos"
    - **Administrator**: admin / moohoo
    - **Domain-Administrator**: department / moohoo
    - **Mailbox**: demo@440044.xyz / moohoo

    *The login credentials work for both variants*.

### success

!!! success "Always up to date"
        The demo instances get the latest updates directly after releases from GitHub. Fully automatic, without any downtime!

## Aufklappbar
??? question "How to add plugins to the Docker image?"

    Material for MkDocs only bundles selected plugins in order to keep the size
    of the official image small. If the plugin you want to use is not included,
    you can add them easily:

    === "Material for MkDocs"

        Create a `Dockerfile` and extend the official image:

        ``` Dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
        FROM squidfunk/mkdocs-material
        RUN pip install mkdocs-macros-plugin
        RUN pip install mkdocs-glightbox
        ```

    === "Insiders"

        Clone or fork the Insiders repository, and create a file called
        `user-requirements.txt` in the root of the repository. Then, add the
        plugins that should be installed to the file, e.g.:

        ``` txt title="user-requirements.txt"
        mkdocs-macros-plugin
        mkdocs-glightbox
        ```

    Next, build the image with the following command:

    ```
    docker build -t squidfunk/mkdocs-material .
    ```

    The new image will have additional packages installed and can be used
    exactly like the official image.

## Example (Authentik & Roundcube)

This example assumes you have:

- A working DMS server set up
- An Authentik server set up ([documentation](https://goauthentik.io/docs/installation/))
- A Roundcube server set up (either [docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/roundcube/roundcubemail/) or [bare metal](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/wiki/Installation))

!!! example "Setup Instructions"

    === "1. Docker Mailserver"
        Edit the following values in `mailserver.env`:
        ```env
        # -----------------------------------------------
        # --- OAUTH2 Section ----------------------------
        # -----------------------------------------------

        # empty => OAUTH2 authentication is disabled
        # 1 => OAUTH2 authentication is enabled
        ENABLE_OAUTH2=1

        # Specify the user info endpoint URL of the oauth2 provider
        OAUTH2_INTROSPECTION_URL=https://authentik.example.com/application/o/userinfo/
        ```

    === "2. Authentik"
        1. Create a new OAuth2 provider
        2. Note the client id and client secret
        3. Set the allowed redirect url to the equivalent of `https://roundcube.example.com/index.php/login/oauth` for your RoundCube instance.
